# Usage
To use this script you need Python and the GDShare mod by HJFod
1) Download the .ttf font that you want to convert and move it into the folder
2) Open config.txt and insert the name of the font into "path"
3) Change the value of the other parameters as you like, keep size >1 since low values can result in wrong lines, if that happens raise the size value
4) Run FontToGD.py and wait for it to finish
5) Open GD and import the level located in level/level.gmd using GDShare
